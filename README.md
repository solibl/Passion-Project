#StreamBro

A web app that utilizes sinatra and ruby for a CRUD app.

Twitch API was used to create the user pages of the main streamers. 

A couple of features was added that twitch.tv did not offer. 
* A page to view all the streams on the same page that you are subscribed to.
* A carousel menu bar that is more modern than a bunch of cover pictures for the games.
